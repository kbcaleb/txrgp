  <dt><h4>Convenient</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our <span style="font-weight: bold">virtual debt resolution process</span> means there are no physical meetings
        for the parties to travel and attend. The principal parties continue about their normal
        business while our process toggles between the parties using telephone, fax, written or e-
        mail communications.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h4>Low Profile</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This process is less visible and moves along quietly and efficiently
        without any unwanted fanfare or publicity.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h4>Deliberation Time</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our process allows each party the leisure of time to carefully
        deliberate their position and, if needed, consult with others using as much time as is
        reasonably needed before responding to resolution proposal. There is no pressure to
        make spontaneous decisions at face-to-face meetings.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h4>Delegation of Work</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our process allows senior decision makers to delegate the day-to-
        day details of the <span style="font-weight: bold">virtual debt resolution process</span> to subordinates while reserving final
        approval authority.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h4>Reduced Cost</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our process replaces the need for expensive, time consuming and
        sometimes intimidating collection and legal processes. We guide the process in the right
        direction to desired results saving significant time and money.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h4>Friendly</h4></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our process is non-adversarial, very personable, and dedicated for reaching
        amiable resolutions for the parties.</p>
    </dd>
